## 🤖 How this was built

This project was built in a single one-shot loop skill (brainstorm, plan, cook, review) powered by **AgentKit Engineer**.

---

Windows Explorer thumbnails & preview pane for **Adobe Illustrator (.ai)**, **Photoshop (.psd/.psb)**, **EPS** and **SVG** files, without installing any Adobe software.

A lightweight COM shell extension written in Rust, shipped as a per-machine x64 MSI.

## Why

Explorer shows blank icons for design files unless you install heavyweight suites or risky third-party tools (some of which hijack your file associations, looking at you, SageThumbs). This project renders real content thumbnails and previews while **never touching your file associations**: `.ai` stays owned by Illustrator, double-click behavior never changes, and uninstalling removes every trace.

## Formats

| Format | How the thumbnail is produced |
|---|---|
| `.ai` (modern, PDF-based) | First page rendered via bundled [pdfium](https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries) |
| `.ai` (legacy, EPS-based) | Embedded DOS-EPS TIFF → `%AI_Thumbnail` → XMP thumbnail → Ghostscript* |
| `.psd` / `.psb` | Embedded Photoshop thumbnail resource, falling back to the flattened composite |
| `.eps` | Embedded DOS-EPS TIFF preview → XMP thumbnail → Ghostscript* |
| `.svg` | Rendered with [resvg](https://github.com/linebender/resvg) (external references disabled) |

\* Files with **no embedded preview at all** are rendered through [Ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com) **if it is installed**, as an isolated, sandboxed (`-dSAFER`), timeout-guarded subprocess. Ghostscript is AGPL and is therefore never bundled; the optional `-setup.exe` bundle offers to download the official installer as a separate product.

## Install

Grab from [Releases](https://github.com/teexiii/ai-psd-thumbnails/releases):

- **`ai-psd-thumbnails-<ver>.msi`** - the shell extension only (pick this if you don't care about preview-less EPS files, or already have Ghostscript).
- **`ai-psd-thumbnails-setup-<ver>.exe`** - same MSI, plus offers to download & install official Ghostscript first when it's missing (needs internet during install).

After installing, thumbnails appear for newly viewed files. Files Explorer has already cached as "no thumbnail" need a cache clear (`scripts/clear-thumb-cache.ps1` from an elevated PowerShell) or simply copy/rename them once.

## What it never does

- Never changes the default program, ProgID, or OpenWith entry of any extension, everything registers under association-neutral `HKCR\SystemFileAssociations`.
- Never loads Ghostscript in-process and never bundles it.
- Uninstall removes only its own registry keys and files.
- Bonus: the installer detects a known SageThumbs leftover that hijacks `.ai` and restores `Adobe.Illustrator.28`.

## Build from source

Requires Rust (MSVC toolchain), and WiX 4.0.6 for the installer.

```powershell
cargo build --workspace --release           # → target/release/thumb_viewer.dll
cargo test --workspace --exclude installer-ca
installer/build-msi.ps1                     # → installer/ai-psd-thumbnails-<ver>.msi
installer/build-bundle.ps1                  # → installer/ai-psd-thumbnails-setup-<ver>.exe
```

Dev registration without the MSI: elevated `scripts/dev-register.ps1` / `dev-unregister.ps1`. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full operational reference (architecture, pdfium pin, registry contract, dev-loop gotchas).
